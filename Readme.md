### A JavaScript-based localization and decoding of EAN-13 barcodes with HTML5

SlaRle (SLA - Scanline-Algorithm, RLE - Run-Length-Encoding) is a pure JavaScript implementation for locating barcode regions in images and decoding EAN-13 barcodes.

This algorithm was implemented during the work for my master's thesis.
The aim was to create an app using HTML5 with client-side barcode recognition functionality.
As mentioned above, SlaRle consists of two parts: localization and decoding.
Localization is based on an algorithm from Stern [1] with enhanced parameterization.
Decoding follows the description from O'Sullivan et al. [2] with the additional feature of scanline movement if a scan wasn't successful.

SlaRle is far from perfect, but tries to find a compromise between performance and accuracy in scanning EAN-13 barcodes.
During the implementation, the algorithm was tested against the 1055 images from Muenster BarcodeDB [3] with the following results:
