### A JavaScript-based localization and decoding of EAN-13 barcodes with HTML5

SlaRle (SLA - Scanline-Algorithm, RLE - Run-Length-Encoding) is a pure JavaScript implementation for locating barcode regions in images and decoding EAN-13 barcodes.

This algorithm was implemented during the work for my master's thesis.
The aim was to create an app using HTML5 with client-side barcode recognition functionality.
As mentioned above, SlaRle consists of two parts: localization and decoding.
Localization is based on an algorithm from Stern [1] with enhanced parameterization.
Decoding follows the description from O'Sullivan et al. [2] with the additional feature of scanline movement if a scan wasn't successful.

SlaRle is far from perfect, but tries to find a compromise between performance and accuracy in scanning EAN-13 barcodes.
Therefore, only horizontal barcodes will be detected due to the scanline algorithm that starts from the top and ends at the bottom.
During the implementation, the algorithm was tested against the 1055 images from Muenster BarcodeDB [3].
Due to the horizontal barcode limitation, some images needed to be rotated from [3]: 167 images by 90° and 32 by 180°.
After this modification, SlaRle reached the following results:

- 70,9 % accuracy at 480px maximum image size
- 81,3 % accuracy at 640px max
- 84,4 % accuracy at 800px max


### Demo

Please check out the demo at: http://bobbyjay.github.io/SlaRle.js/
For taking a photo or selecting an existing photo (depends on the mobile browser) click "Load Image". This will load your image into the canvas at the bottom scaled with the maximum resolution set in the input field above. After the image is loaded the "Scan" button will trigger SlaRle.

**Info:** Currently, there are some problems, when the barcode is too large. There is a maximum width between to gradients/lines that will be exceeded. ALso, the feedback isn't perfect, if the algorithm is successful it will output the EAN and if not the result will be empty. I will work on this for the demo and also try to show the result of the localisation in the canvas.
