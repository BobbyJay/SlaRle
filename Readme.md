### A JavaScript-based localization and decoding of EAN-13 barcodes with HTML5

SlaRle (SLA - Scanline-Algorithm, RLE - Run-Length-Encoding) is a pure JavaScript implementation for locating barcode regions in images and decoding.
It is made for product scans and therefore decoding EAN-13 barcodes.

This algorithm was implemented during the work for my master's thesis.
The aim was to create an app using HTML5 with client-side barcode recognition functionality.
